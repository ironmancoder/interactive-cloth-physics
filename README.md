# Interactive Cloth Physics

A physics-based cloth simulation implemented in C++ using SFML. Features include:
- Realistic cloth movement with gravity and wind effects
- Interactive tearing mechanism
- Color visualization of cloth tension
- Verlet integration for stable physics simulation

Inspired by 'Building a Particle Simulation Physics Engine in C++' tutorial.
